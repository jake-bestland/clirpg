This is my first cli role playing game created using the instructions from my CodingNomads python 101 course

I created this game using Visual Studio Code version 1.86.0

You can run this game in your terminal.

I intend on making improvements to this game as I learn to code more.  It currently has one minor issue.  If the user doesn't enter the desired input, or an acceptable input; the game will tell them what is acceptable input, and instead of returning to that question, it starts the game over from the beginning.
